# OpenGLIntro
#### 1. To start, make sure to read the OpenGLTutorialSetup file and set up OpenGL and CMAKE properly for your machine. You will need to know how to use basic shell commands and pay close attention to the setup directions.
#### 2. If you have properly set up the softwares and libraries, setup the environmental variables, generated the project with CMake, you will be able to compile the code in the terminal with the following command:
``
make Assignment1
``
#### 3. Then you will be able to execute it via the following command:
``
./Assignment1
``
#### 4. Read the Assignment_01.pdf for clarification of deliverables and program capabilities!
#### 5. For this project, I was given starter code which I built upon based on the Assignment_01 instructions. I contributed solely to the C++ code.
